                                including Leyton Orient, Millwall, Leicester City, and Norwich City. Kane's involvement
                                at Tottenham began to increase following the arrival of Mauricio Pochettino as head
                                coach in 2014. In his first full season at the club, Kane scored 31 goals across all
                                competitions, was the Premier League's second-highest goalscorer, and won PFA Young
                                Player of the Year.</article>

                        <div class="player-info">
                            <article>Kevin De Bruyne (born 28 June 1991) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays
                                as a midfielder for Premier League club Manchester City, where he is vice-captain, and
                                the Belgium national team. He is one of just three players (the others being Cristiano
                                Ronaldo and Thierry Henry) to have won the PFA Players' Player of the Year award back to
                                back, and the only midfielder and Belgium player to have done so in English football
                                history.[5]

                                De Bruyne began his career at Genk, where he was a regular player when they won the
                                2010–11 Belgian Pro League. In 2012, he joined English club Chelsea, where he was used
                                sparingly and then loaned to Werder Bremen. He signed with Wolfsburg for £18 million in
                                2014, where he established himself as one of the best players in the Bundesliga and was
                                integral in the club's 2014–15 DFB-Pokal win. In the summer of 2015, De Bruyne joined
                                Manchester City for a club record £54 million. He has since won three Premier League
                                titles, five League Cups and an FA Cup with the club. In 2017–18, he had a significant
                                role in Manchester City's record in becoming the only Premier League team to attain 100
                                points in a single season. In 2019–20, De Bruyne tied the record for most assists in a
                                Premier League season and was awarded Player of the Season.</article>

                            <h2>All Highlights<br>Copa America 2021</h2>
                            <article>Copa America 2021 is over, and Argentina is the queen of South America after 28
                                years, with Messi finally winning his first international title. It was a long journey
                                with 4 group matches and three knock-out matches. But let’s overview how the tournament
                                went. After rejecting the invitation from CONMEBOL, Qatar and Australia forced the
                                competition to be formed of two groups of 5 teams each. Argentina, Chile, Paraguay,
                                Bolivia, and Uruguay were in Group A. The first round saw Argentina against Chile. Leo
                                Messi scored from an outrageous free-kick, and then Chile equalized with Vargas after
                                the rebound of the missed penalty from Vidal (1-1). It was not the start that Argentina
                                would want, but they immediately got back stronger with three wins in the second, third,
                                and fifth rounds. 1-0 against both Uruguay and Paraguay, with goals from Guido Rodriguez
                                and Alejandro Gomez, respectively. The last game saw Argentina take on the last place of
                                group A, Bolivia. They went running riots, winning 4-1 with Lionel Messi being the Man
                                of the match with two goals. The scoresheet also appeared for the first time in the
                                event ‘El Toro’ Lautaro Martinez and Alejandro Gomez with the second goal in Copa
                                America 2021. Uruguay, another contender for the cup, lost against Argentina 1-0 in
                                round 2, took one point after being behind in a final 1-1 draw vs. Chile with Luis
                                Suárez responding to Edu Vargas. After 1 point in two games, Uruguay managed to win the
                                two other matches 0-2 versus Bolivia with the help of an own goal and Edinson Cavani.
                                The last round saw them against Paraguay, and the result was 1-0 for La Celeste with a
                                penalty goal from Cavani. Chile secured a 1-0 win versus Bolivia after drawing 1-1
                                against Argentina in the first match, with Brereton being the hero of the three points.
                                Another 1-1 draw against Uruguay closed their group campaign with a 2-0 loss against
                                Paraguay, Samudio, and a penalty from Almiron caused the defeat. Paraguay started the
                                competition with a 3-1 win with Bolivia. A great second-half comeback with Kaku and
                                Romero twice made the penalty converted in goal in the first half from Saavedra useless.
                                Bolivia is the last-placed team in group A with 0 points losing against all their
                                opponents. 3-1 vs. Paraguay, 1-0 vs. Chile, 2-0 vs. Uruguay, and 4-1 vs. Argentina Made
                                Bolivia the worst team of Copa America 2021. The final standing of this group saw
                                Argentina on top with 10 points, Uruguay with 7, Paraguay with 6, Chile 5, and Bolivia
                                0.
